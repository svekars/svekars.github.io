	"content": " What is Kubernetes security? Kubernetes is an open-source platform that provides APIs for container management. As a declarative system, Kubernetes empowers cloud administrators to integrate containers into existing infrastructures seamlessly without dictating which monitoring, storage, CI/CD, or other components to use. A variety of workloads can run on a Kubernetes cluster. The container technology that is being widely adopted by many enterprises provides a number of valuable advantages compared to old data center models and even virtualization. While virtual machines were a step forward for many companies, VMs still have many disadvantages mainly because of the cumbersome upgrade process and heavyweight. Containers, on the other hand, are agile, lightweight, and portable. They provide resource isolation while saving computational resources.\nHowever, when it comes to security, containers alone might not be your best choice. While Kubernetes provides some basic security capabilities, they are limited and do not guarantee full protection of your infrastructure. A robust container security solution carries the following attributes:\n Platform-agnostic Whether you use Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or any other container orchestrator, a good security solution integrates seamlessly and provides the same level of protection to all of them. Observable Provides real-time insights into your container platform health, detects threats and notifies the system administrator through the configured notification channels. End-to-end Provides protection to all components of your container ecosystem, including the control plane, workloads, images, and so on. Continuous Constantly verifies the state of your cluster by running multiple benchmark test to verify the integrity of your platform.  "
